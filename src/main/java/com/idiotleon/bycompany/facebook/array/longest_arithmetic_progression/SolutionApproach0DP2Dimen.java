/**
 * You are given two arrays of integers a and b, 
 * which are both sorted in an ascending order and contain unique elements (i.e. no duplicates). 
 * You can take several (possibly zero) numbers from the array b and insert them to a at any positions in any order. 
 * You want the array a to be an arithmetic progression after this. 
 * Your task is to find the longest length of the resulting arithmetic progression 
 * represented by array a that can be achieved. If it is impossible to obtain an 
 * array forming an arithmetic progression, return -1. 
 * 
 * Example 
 *  For a = [0, 4, 8, 16] and b = [0, 2, 6, 12, 14, 20], 
 *  the output should be maxArithmeticLength(a, b) = 6 . 
 *  You can add b[3] = 12 and b[5] = 20 a and obtain array [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20], 
 *  which is an arithmetic progression of length
