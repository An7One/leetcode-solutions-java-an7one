/**
 * Follow-up beyond contest:
 * 
 * Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS?
 * If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution?
 * If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution?
 * What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the most time-consuming part and memory consuming part of it? How to optimize?
 * How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?
 *
