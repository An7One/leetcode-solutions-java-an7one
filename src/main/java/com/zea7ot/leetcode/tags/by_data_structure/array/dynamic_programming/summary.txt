# Prefix Sums:
    about why `count += prefixSums.get(sum - k)`
    https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/discuss/535507/Explanation-to-why-map.get(sum-k)-is-done-than-count%2B%2B

    store previous sum and the times of this sum, because sum[i, j] = sum[0, j] - sum[0, i - 1], this is a very very important idea
