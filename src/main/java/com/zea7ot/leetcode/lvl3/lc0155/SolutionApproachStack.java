/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/
 * 
 * Time Complexity : O(1) for all operations.
 * push(...): Checking the top of a Stack, comparing numbers, and pushing to the top of a Stack (or adding to the end of an Array or List) are all O(1) operations. 
 * Therefore, this overall is an O(1) operation.
 * pop(...): Popping from a Stack (or removing from the end of an Array, or List) is an O(1) operation.
 * top(...): Looking at the top of a Stack is an O(1) operation.
 * getMin(...): Same as above. This operation is O(1) because we do not need to compare values to find it. 
 * If we had not kept track of it on the Stack, and instead had to search for it each time, the overall time complexity would have been O(n).
 * 
 * Space Complexity : O(n)
 * Worst case is that all the operations are push. 
 * In this case, there will be O(2 \cdot n) = O(n)O(2â‹…n)=O(n) space used.
